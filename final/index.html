            <p> You are an engineer employed by the interplanetary organization Wonk Enterprises. This organization creates high-tech robots for specialized tasks, such as farming. 
                They've been using entire planets for resources and reaping the rewards with little effort or repercussions. Your ship has crash landed on an unknown planet where
                these robots are going haywire! They have gained a sort of twisted sentience, and attack on first sight. Using the scrap you find and your mechanical expertise to
                your advantage, your goal is to fight off the robots as you try to repair your ship so you can leave the planet.</p>
            <p><i>‘Be a robot mechanic’, they said. ‘Easy money’, they said. We’re pretty sure the job description didn’t mention crash landing on a far away planet, 
                    with thousands of crazed worker robots out for blood!</i></p>
            <p> Scrap Mechanic is a game mainly about creativity and imagination. The developers of the game were heavily inspired by the widely popular game Minecraft.
                As such, the two games share much in common. Scrap Mechanic is a multiplayer, open world, sandbox building game with both creative and survival modes.
                But unlike Minecraft, the main draw of Scrap Mechanic is the physics aspect; not only can you build houses, pixel art, or whatever else you desire,
                you can also build functional creations such as vehicles, catapults, and much more! Much like Minecraft, there is no final goal set in stone;
                it can be whatever you want it to be. The possibilities are endless.</p>
            <p> In Scrap Mechanic, the world is divided into 'tiles' that can contain structures and/or resources.
                These tiles are randomly placed in the world at creation, so no two worlds are the same. The world is not infinite, but that is fine as it probably isn't
                necessary for this game. There are three game modes offered with very different ways to play. Firstly, there is the creative mode. In creative mode,
                you are not limited by resources or health. You can build whatever you want however you want. The next mode is challenge mode, which is where you are essentially
                given an obstacle course and must overcome it with the given materials. Additionally, you can create your own challenges or play others' challenges!
                The final mode is survival mode. In survival mode, you must farm for food, mine for resources, and battle the unrelenting 'farmerbots'. The game is still in
                early access, which means that the developers are still working on updating the game, and it is nowhere near finished. The developers also tease new features in
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/387990">devlogs</a> and on their <a href="https://twitter.com/ScrapMechanic">Twitter account</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="lower-text center">The in-depth details</h2>
            <p class="lower-text">There are a lot of intricate details to this game, and much of it is not easy to show through text and images.
                As such, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=about+scrap+mechanic">searching YouTube</a> for videos to better grasp the game.
                Here, I will briefly describe gameplay and some other features in the game. To start, I recommend playing the default challenges and creative mode.
                This will help you familiarize yourself with how building works and what some of the interactable parts do. If you go straight to survival, it may
                become overwhelming or frustrating. Challenge mode is self-explanatory; it shows you the basics. However, if you ever forget how to do something, pressing 'H' will
                bring up the handbook, which is a guide on how to build with the parts. This game doesn't focus on combat. If you want a game with great combat
                with diverse weapons, this is not the game for you. Fair warning: if you want a raw experience in the game, I suggest not clicking reveal.
                I know that some like to discover how the game works, and not be told. (For more in-depth detail on the game [definite spoiler warning!], 
                look at the <a href="https://scrapmechanic.fandom.com">wiki page</a>!)
            </p>
            <button id="spoilbtn" class="center" style="background-color: slategray;" onclick="spoil()">Reveal combat details</button>
            <span id="spoiler" class="hidden" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                <p class="lower-text">In survival, the combat is very straightforward. At the beginning, all you have is a sledgehammer. Swing it at the enemies to attack.
                    If you do this while walking backwards, it becomes quite difficult for the normal bots to hit you. However, you have to be aware of the red farmbot. 
                    They are immune to your hammer, so you'll need the big guns (literally). After you've obtained a spud gun variant, you can then shoot your enemies with
                    potatoes! It is much easier to battle the bots when you have a spud gun, but if you aren't careful, you could run out of ammo quickly.
